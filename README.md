# Clustering and Ensemble Learning

This repo contains Python code for exploring machine learning techniques: **k-means clustering** and **ensemble learning with decision trees**. The code was developed as part of an assignment for the Machine Learning and Data Mining course at Oregon State University.

## Overview

The repository includes two scripts:

- `kmeans.py`: Implements k-means clustering and applies it to both synthetic 2D data and high-dimensional image features. It includes visualizations of the clustering process, analysis of randomness in clustering results, and how error changes as the number of clusters increases.
- `decision.py`: Trains a single decision tree and an ensemble of decision trees on the breast cancer dataset. It measures and compares model performance and computes a correlation matrix to analyze prediction similarity between ensemble members.
